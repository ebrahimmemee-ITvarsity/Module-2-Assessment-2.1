                    <p>All Swatch watches come with the label Swiss Made. Swiss Made embodies a concept of quality that has been forged over the years. It includes the technical quality of watches (accuracy, reliability, water-resistance and shock-resistance), as well as their aesthetic quality (elegance and originality of design). It covers both traditional manufacturing and new technologies (micro-electronics).</p>
                    <p>Since 2014, Nu Metro has enhanced cinema-going around the country through the introduction of cutting-edge cinema experiences 4DX, Xtreme and VIP at select cineplexes nationwide.</p>
