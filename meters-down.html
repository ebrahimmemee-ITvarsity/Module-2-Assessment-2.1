                    <h3>The Plot</h3>
                    <p>On the rebound after a devastating break-up, Lisa is ready for adventure while on vacation in Mexico. Still, she needs a little extra persuasion when her daring sister, Kate, suggests they go shark-diving with some locals. Once underwater in a protective cage, Lisa and Kate catch a once-in-a-lifetime, face-to-face look at majestic Great Whites. When their worst fears are realised and the cage breaks away from their boat, they find themselves plummeting to the bottom of the seabed, too deep to radio for help, and their oxygen supplies rapidly dwindling.</p>
